## Extracting binaries

Hints for extracting binaries from https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html (dpkg and rpm2cpio is available on Homebrew).

Debian/Ubuntu

    dpkg -x wkhtmltox_0.12.5-1.trusty_amd64.deb .

CentOS

    rpm2cpio wkhtmltox-0.12.5-1.centos7.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv

macOS

    xar -xf wkhtmltox-0.12.5-1.macos-cocoa.pkg
    cat Payload | gunzip -dc | cpio -i

## Compression

Binaries should be compressed with `gzip --best` after extracting. The matching binary will be extracted on first
execution of `bin/wkhtmltopdf`.

## Testing with Docker

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed (see https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ for more
information).

There are Dockerfiles for the supported Linux based distributions under `.docker`. You can build them all with
`docker-compose build` and run each individually with e.g. `docker-compose run ubuntu_18.04`.

There also is a rudimentary minitest test that simply invokes `docker-compose run` for each distribution and
expects to see the output of `wkhtmltopdf --version`. Just run `rake` to run it. 

You can clean up after testing with `docker-compose down --rmi all`.
